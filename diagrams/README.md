##### fb_comparison.pdf

Comparison between ACS (dotted), FTF (dashed) and PFB 8-tap Hann windowed PFB filter responses.

##### fft_resp.pdf

![fft_resp](fft_resp.png)
Effect of applying a windowing function to an FFT. The main lobe is broadened but the sidelobes are supressed.

##### fir_filter.pdf

![fir_filter](fir_filter.png)
Block diagram showing a FIR filter.


##### pfb_chart.pdf

![pfb_chart](pfb_chart.png)
The diagram shows an input signal being divided into $M$ taps, each with $P$ points. Within each tap, the signal is  multiplied by the filter coefficients, then a sum across taps is performed. After this, another $P$ points are read, and the signals propagate left-to-right into the next tap (following the arrows).
